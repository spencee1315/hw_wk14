# Tech Blog (MVC)

## Description

For week 14 of the UW Coding Bootcamp my homework invited me to build a CMS-style blog site similar to a Wordpress site, where developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other developers' posts as well. My application follows the MVC paradigm in its architectural structure, using Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequilize as the ORM, and the express-session nmp package for authentication.

## Usage

Your application's homepage will contain any existing blog posts with viewing restrictions in placed so only users logged-in can view posts. To get started a user should login as a returning user, or signup as a new user. Once signed up or logged-in the user will have full access to the application and can create, edit, comment on, or delete posts. Once done a user can logout to secure their personal dashboard content.
